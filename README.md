# AI-Contract-Clause-Identifier
A tool that scans legal/financial contracts and flags high-risk clauses (indemnification, liability caps, warranty terms, etc.), helping businesses quickly assess potential exposure.

1. **Indemnification** â€“ Obligations to cover losses or damages.  
2. **Limitation of Liability** â€“ Caps on damages a party must pay.  
3. **Warranty / Defects** â€“ Promises about product/service quality.  
4. **Termination Clauses** â€“ Conditions under which the contract ends.  
5. **Confidentiality / Trade Secrets** â€“ Restrictions on sharing information.
